How did we decide what to evaluate?\n\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what _you_ submitted to us. This is the\nlist of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list\nthat met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate\nthose on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos _you_ gave\nus.\n\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We\nwill ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker\nrepo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo.

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus\nmarks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it\nimproves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6\nassignments but missed GA7 for some reason?  \nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would\nbe really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\n\nThank you and Regards  \nAkshit \n Post 2: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.  \nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4\nseems quite different.  \nIs this information available to everyone @carlton sir? \n Post 3: Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir,  \nI hope you are doing well.\n\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the\n7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention\nof bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5\nbonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2,\nsome of us were unable to complete GA7.\n\nNow, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email\nstating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute\nto the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since\nthis information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to\nconsider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these\nbonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of\nassessment.\n\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful\nif you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\n\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\n\nBest regards,  \nDigvijaysinh Chudasama \n Post 4: The Same happened to me.

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15%\nweight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full\nmarks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5\nand GA6, which you can verify.\n\nNow I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7.\nIf any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be\ncommunicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as\nstudents, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.\n\nI could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should\nbe fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if\nGA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to\nattempt or review it accordingly.\n\n**@carlton** , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking\nforward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all\nstudents. \n Post 8: @carlton sir ,\n\nThis would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us\nwere proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra\nweightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the\nother students ?  \nKindly consider \n Post 9: same for me also …  \nPlease consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the\noverall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.  \n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini \n Post 10: Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.  \nIt’s really unfair \n Post 11: It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review\nweek-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something\nabout this. \n Post 12: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand  \nI have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required,\nalong with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request\nthat 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not\ncommunicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who\nwere unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.\n\nRegards:  \nAkash \n Post 13: @carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has\nunfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence\nand a smile. \n Post 16: Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir,  \nI hope you are well\n\nAccording to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of\nthe 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of\nany bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7\nbefore the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2,\nsome of us couldn’t complete GA7.\n\nRecently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve\nbeen given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score\nand possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared\nearlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for\nthose who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a\nsubmission review or another form of assessment.\n\nWe genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you\ncould provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.\n\nBest regards,  \nPalaash V.

Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given\n. Please do consider our request . Thank you \n Post 19: Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too\n, and now bonus too  \nin the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed ,\nbut its not \n Post 20: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand\n\nThe sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has\nleft many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this\nchange. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated\n“best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about\ntransparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic\nassessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a\nfundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course\ncoordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated\non an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and\nacademic integrity. \n Post 21: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand  \nYes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7\nGAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to\npressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would\nhave done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.  \nThank you \n Post 22: @carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7\nassignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and\nprojects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which\nseems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were\nnot able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a\nedge\n\nIf it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to\nimprove our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best\npossible solution for this\n\nThanking you\n\nwaiting for your answer",

Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.\n  2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.\n  3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.\n\nThe assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved.\nKindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon\nas possible.\n\nThank you for your support. \n Post 14: Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using\n> historical data.\n\nbut is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are\nspecified? \n Post 15: Let’s wait for their response.  \nI submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4 \n Post 16: @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini  \nCan you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides\nwith Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and\nstudy for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your\nproblem).  \nThanks \n Post 17: Hi @all\n\nQuestion intends you to select most correlated one.  \nSelect option which is absolute highest. \n Post 18: @Jivraj \\- Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices\nare matching with the answer.

The Emergency\nManagement Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most\nefficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The\nfour communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant\nHarbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village :\n(42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central\nCommand Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package,\ncalculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs\nCommunity.

Thankyou! \n Post 3: Hi @22f3000585\n\nStandard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or\nLICENSE.md(all caps).\n\nAdding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs\n\nKind regards \n Post 4: image931×108 3.89 KB\n\n  \nSir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  \nSir can you please consider it. Thank you! \n Post 5: Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the\nfollowing message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.  \n\nScreenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM1776×228 15.5 KB \n Post 6: @24ds2000125 @22f3000585\n\nI completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.\n\nBut the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to\ntheir repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to\nfix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  \nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\n\nThese things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants\nstudents to understand. These “minor” things matter.\n\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot.\nMinor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\n\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness\nto everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project\ndeadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was\nclearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\n\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has\nmade and I have shared the reasons why.\n\nKindest regards \n Post 7: Sir,  \nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  \nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’\non the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and\nbecause I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the\n16th of Feb itself).  \nI completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole\nreason i made that change on the 16th.  \nI completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility\nthat you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly\nappreciate it.  \nThankyou! \n Post 8: One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb.\nSo if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and\nevaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your\nsubmission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in\nthe github present at the version before the 18th. \n Post 9: Well noted sir. Thanks a lot! \n Post 10: Sir, I received the mail today -  \n\nimage652×156 5.43 KB\n\n  \nSir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to\nthis reason before the deadline itself.  \n\nimage836×101 18.2 KB\n\n  \nSir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due\nto this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was\nalready present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in\nthe google form that was provided.  \n\nimage1113×487 20.2 KB\n\n  \nSir can you please check.  \nThankyou",

    "content": "Post 1: @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj  \nDear TDS Team,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts\nrelated to different aspects of the course that require clarification and\nresolution.\n\n### 1\\. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\n  * **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)\n\n  * **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n### 2\\. Project Updates\n\n  * **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n  * **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the _Project 2_ discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link)\n\n### 3\\. ROE Score Update\n\n  * While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking\nforward to your response.\n\nBest regards,  \nLakshay \n Post 2: tigertds212×148 6.99 KB\n\n  \n@carlton It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as\nwell—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting\nexcessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated. \n Post 3: lakshaygarg654:\n\n> **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on\n> exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to\n> _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like\n> we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal.\nBut there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around\nto deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations\nthat are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to\nthe TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are\nable to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever\ndoubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are\nimmediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs.\nThe TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors\nand the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets\nimmediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3\nset of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the\nanswers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were\nparameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely\ncumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive\nto all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have\nseen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek\nportal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that\ndirectly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6\nwas straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is\nonce again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek\nPortal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to\nour preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least\ndisruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\n> **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or\n> before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate.\nEach project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB,\nwe have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for\nall of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough,\nyou can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+\nsubmissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all\nhands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical.\nSo while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations\nare at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter\nwith utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on\nevery set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it.\nAnand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access\nto the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we\nare all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry\ndock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in\nthe estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship\nwhile its rolling down the slipway.\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\n> ### 3\\. ROE Score Update\n>\n>   * While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE\n> have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to\n> get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n>\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE\nin the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\n\nKind regards \n Post 4: We do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster.\n\nThanks,  \nKind regards \n Post 5: Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We\nappreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and\nimproving the course experience.\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to\nthe course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the\ncourse team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help\nus understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1\nresults. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in\nthe same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the\nmaximum marks is 100.\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the\nsolution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project\n2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would\nbe greatly appreciated.  \nLooking forward to your response.\n\nRegards,  \nLakshay",

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real\ntime (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get\nyou to realise some key things:\n\n  1. The chaos of ROE.\n  2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n  3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n  4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n  5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**\n  6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n  7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n  8. How limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students\nfelt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  \nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so\nthat you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But\nthis is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the\ndiscussions were very intense even for us.\n\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with\nnew aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without\na time limit).\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise\nto the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure.\nThe TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used\nto the clock.\n\nKind regards \n Post 17: Thank you! will check out the session today \n Post 19: Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was `\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"`  \nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over\nthe period names were changed of this constituency  \ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\n\n    \n    \n    df_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR\nSRIHARGOBINDPUR\nSRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n    \n\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only?\nbut then this constituency is not availble after 1957\n\nusing above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR\n\ndrive.google.com\n\n### df_gobindpur.csv\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\nthen i used margin formula as\n\n    \n    \n    margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\n    \n\nusing this i got answer for 1st question as\n\n    \n    \n    YEAR                              1992\n    AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\n    WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH\n    WINNER_PARTY                       CPI\n    WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0\n    RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH\n    RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC\n    RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0\n    MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114\n    \n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  \npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks \n Post 20: shubhamatkal:\n\n>\n>     df_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI\n> GOBINDPUR\nSRIHARGOBINDPUR\nSRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n>  \n\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\n\nshubhamatkal:\n\n> which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\n\nThat answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python\nsnippets.  \nKind regards. \n Post 21: @Jivraj @carlton  \n“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were\nassigned to me.

    "topic_title": "Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness",
    "content": "Post 1: Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi\n\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in\nsupporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have\nbeen helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning\nexperience.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges\nin keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n## **Key Challenges Faced**\n\n###  **Lack of Prerequisites**\n\nThis course did not list any **prerequisites** , leading many\nstudents—including those from **non-technical backgrounds** —to enroll with\nthe expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\n**course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than\nanticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n###  **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**\n\nThe **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us\nto **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite\nputting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them\nsuccessfully.\n\n###  **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**\n\nMany students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback** ,\nwhich suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has\nbeen a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students\nwithout prior experience.\n\n###  **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded\nAssignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling\nto meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE** , which are significantly\nharder than anticipated.\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also\nhope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts\nbut still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a\nrevision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded\nAssignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of\nstudents are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to\npass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the\ncourse.\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we\nare all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the\ngrading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that\neveryone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration\nand hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course\nobjectives. \n Post 2: Yes sir please look into this \n Post 3: @Anand @Bharathi Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern. \n Post 4: Yes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that\nhow non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course.\nPlease consider this request.  \n@carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand \n Post 5: Yes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil sir @Bharathi Mam,  \nPlss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam. \n Post 6: Right,  \nI put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.\n\nI tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better\non next mock.\n\nI completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was\nmy mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite\nworking so hard. \n Post 7: Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini  \nCould you please look into the above issue?\n\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading\npattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\n\n### **Grading Concerns**\n\n**Final Course Score:**  \nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  \n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\n\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely\ndifficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  \nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.  \nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly\nimpacting their overall scores.\n\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was\nprovided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as\nthe live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a\nresult, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n\n### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**\n\n  * Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals** , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n  * The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n  * The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\n### **Request for Improvement**\n\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\n  1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2** , well in advance of the deadline.\n  2. **More structured and accessible support** , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\n  3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels** , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements\ncan be made. Looking forward to your response. \n Post 8: Please look into it sir. \n Post 9: Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought\nof quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team\ngives a more detailed response.\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not\nbe changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my\nmind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put\nin the OP.\n\n  1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n> **This course is quite hard**\n>\n> Here’s students’ feedback:\n>\n>   * It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024. # # #\n>   * Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if\n> possible. # # #\n>   * Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #\n>   * LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #\n>   * The ROE is hard. #\n>\n\n>\n> **Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course.**\n> Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be\n> too tough for you now.\n\n  2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - _Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help_  \nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n> **We encourage learning by sharing**\n>\n> You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code.\n> Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n>\n> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent\n> the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s\n> important to learn how to do that well.\n>\n> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time,\n> prioritize.\n>\n> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.\n\n  3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  \nOnce again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that\nneither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit\nus. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such\nopen interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching)\nexperience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.\n\n  4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n  5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - _Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them_ The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n  6. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity. \n Post 10: Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term\nbenefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re\nnot concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this\ncourse.\n\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from\nthe modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this\nhard work I should be able to pass the course.\n\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the\ncourse itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack\nof marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at\nthis point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a\nvaluable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\n\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that\nproject 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE\nso that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege\nto pass. \n Post 11: Nicely highlighted the concern of all students.  \nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those\nwith non-technical background.  \nIITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis. \n Post 12: Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting\ndragged into this  … \n Post 13: But still this is a huge Problem …\n\njkmadathil:\n\n> LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # \n Post 14: Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too. \n Post 15: Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is\nunpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This\nis punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading\nsystem in future, even the course is designed very well! \n Post 16: Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I\nam barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though\nremembering everything is super difficult. \n Post 17: You will survive. Just watch tonight’s session.  and prepare and practise.",

    "content": "Post 1: Hello Sir,\n\nI understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs\nscheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or\nif there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be\nable to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\n\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings?\nAdditionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and\nhow the mock links will be shared.\n\nThanks and Regards  \nShalini \n Post 2: Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time… \n Post 3: It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time\nduring the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will\nfreeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it\nlater.\n\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\n\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.  \nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.  \n_The problem is the lack of time._\n\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins\nand attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you\nstand.\n\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to\ndo good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\n\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have\nthe same types of questions. Not with ROE.\n\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.  \nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\n\nKind regards \n Post 4: hi @carlton  \nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i\njoin gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these\ndoubts. thanks in advance! \n Post 5: You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  \nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.  \nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored\neither!  \nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.\n\nKind regards \n Post 6: 3 questions:-\n\n  * will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\n  * will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\n  * will the live solving video lecture be recorded? \n Post 7: 23f1002382:\n\n> will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\n\nThey will be available after the live session has finished.\n\n23f1002382:\n\n> will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\n\nWe will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1\n\n23f1002382:\n\n> will the live solving video lecture be recorded?\n\nYes our live sessions will be recorded. \n Post 8: thanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp\n7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset? \n Post 9: Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to\nother commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will\nthis be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned,\nI will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes. \n Post 10: carlton:\n\n> No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during\n> the live session.\n\nyes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live\nsession from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting\nwrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got\nwrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of\nthis mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls\nunderstand thanks,  \nalso when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1\nta \n Post 11: Hi @shubhamatkal ,\n\nFor question1 provided answer is wrong.  \nRegarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s\nrequried to solve questions.\n\nFor Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately\n\nFor Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers.\n\nKind regards.",

You perhaps wanted to tag the faculty of this\ncourse s.anand (I’m purposely not tagging him; you may do so) \n Post 4: I feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side\nyou are famous (or infamous depending on perspective  )\n\nKind regards \n Post 5: Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is @s.anand\n\nAlso ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set\nbefore the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme.\nExam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.\n\nKind regards \n Post 6: Sir I understand but it will badly affects our CGPA. \n Post 7: Sir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour? \n Post 8: The time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the\nROE.\n\nKind regards",

Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed\n  2. Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.\n\nHow this is beneficial?\n\n  1. As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time\n  2. Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term\n\nOverall this will increase the value of the already most practical and\nrewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance and kind consideration  \nRegards  \nAryan",

    "content": "Post 1: @carlton @s.anand\n\nRelease of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6\nhas been delayed by 10 days.\nCould you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly?\nI am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.\n\nPlease let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan\naccordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic). | Post 2: @Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days\nfor submissions.\n\nWe do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet.\n\nKind regards | Post 3: @carlton\n\nIf possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like\nProject 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance. | Post 4: Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.  \nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the\nexclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the\ndesign/validation phase.\n\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was\nreleased as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\n\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course\nassignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they\nare not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and\nprogramming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for\nthe convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects\nrequire constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved\nto allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors\ndo slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as\nopposed to a semester system.\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.  \nKind regards",

    "content": "Post 1: Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created\nsoon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover\nthese.\n\n  1. Syllabus\n  2. kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice\n  3. I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time\n  4. Any mock or resource to practice from?\n  5. additional tips, if any | Post 2: 1. Modules 1 - 5\n  2. Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.\n  3. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.\n  4. We will have some past ROEs as practise\n  5. … watch sessions\n\nKind regards | Post 3: Thanks for the answer @carlton  \nIs it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short\ndeadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured\n?  \nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about\nstructure. | Post 4: Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it\nwas MCQs?? | Post 5: ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method.\nTherefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether\nMCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\n\nKind regards | Post 6: The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one\nconcept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts\nand use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short\ntime).\n\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience\nshows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome\nwithout significant assistance from the “hooomann”\n\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up\neverything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration\nwith others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet.\nThere is a reason for that. Its very hard.\n\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to\ncombine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the\ndataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain\nsome information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\n\nKind regards | Post 7: Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test? | Post 8: Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team\nthat knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly\nthen quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\n\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter\nor longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is\nunique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30\nmins.",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences\nfrom the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the\nerror wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual\naudio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know\nwhat the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the\nexact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5\nseconds.\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda\nfollowed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of\ndetermination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of\nfriends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage\nbeneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy,\nand every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best\nleft undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice\nemerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some\nsecrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of\nEdmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden\nalliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that\nmanipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation\ntightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with\nnames, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary,\nstrengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal\nhinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored\nevidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for\ndecades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her\nsteps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged\nwith meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the\nmanor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another\nrevelation \" | Post 2: i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg and used this  \nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it worked",

For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py\nwas incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected\noutcome.\n\nThe LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation\nguidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card\nnumber from the image is a sensitive information.\n\nI am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.\n\nNow, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks.

It was\nshowing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by\niitm.\n\nShall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in\ngithub repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect\nthe Dockerfile? | Post 2: The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check\nother sections of your submission like\n\n  * Is the GitHub repo public?\n  * Does it have an MIT license?\n  * Does it have a DockerFile?\n  * Is the Docker image accessible? | Post 3: Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required\nsince the links and names are same. | Post 4: Sir, i got this mail.

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\n\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements\nand yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for\nstudents to make the necessary corrections.\n\nThen once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e\n_yesteday_ , you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\n\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647,\npost:1, topic:167471”]  \n\nimage250×534 3.92 KB\n\n  \n[/quote]\n\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\n\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the\ndeadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\n\nKind regards | Post 10: @carlton sir  \nYes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and\nsubmitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure\nif this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.\n\nI understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email\nlater. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I\nwas extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised\nmy concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if\nmy submission could still be considered\n\nKind regards,  \nArnav Mehta  \n21f3002647 | Post 11: Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in\nDockerfile was small that too on remote repository.

    "content": "Post 1: Hello @carlton and @Jivraj and @s.anand sir\n\nIt is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something\ndecent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request\nto reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly\nmore odds of submitting the project.\n\nThanks  \nVikram | Post 2: @carlton @s.anand Yes Sir please extend the project deadline. | Post 3: yes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in\nprevious terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend\nthe deadline or give out some resources. | Post 4: Yes @s.anand , @carlton ,  \nThe project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress\nand let us submit better work.  \nAdditionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our\ndoubts. | Post 5: @carlton @s.anand yes sir please extend the project deadline. | Post 6: Sir please extend the deadline it’s really hard to do we need more time | Post 7: Yes, it’s too hectic to balance work and this project | Post 8: @carlton @s.anand sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to\nunderstand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our\nbest but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress\nand we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us. | Post 10: @carlton @s.anand sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also\nscheduled on Saturday | Post 11: Please extend the deadline | Post 12: @s.anand @carlton sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very\ndifficult, we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the\nproject and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the\ndeadline could be extended… | Post 13: Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline\ncoinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project\nwill be much better even with the smallest possible extension. | Post 14: Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really\nhelpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks\nincreasing the odds of our submission. @carlton @s.anand | Post 15: Indeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them.  \nEXTEND !!! | Post 16: Kindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have\ntheir GATE exam on Saturday. A slight extension would be greatly helpful. | Post 17: SIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us 2 to 3 days it was helpful\nfor us. | Post 18: @22f1000376 @22f3000276 @23f2004636 @23f2004563 @sharik4real @Mystic_9803\n@Rishabh2 @23f1002279 @varun_parashar @22f2001175\n\nand others…\n\nI have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on\nmultiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the\ndiscussion:\n\n  * We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\n  * All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\n  * Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\n  * We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above,\nincluding the concerns mentioned by students:\n\n**Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.**\n\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section\nand do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an\noverview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both\nsessions to see how we construct these requirements.\n\nKind regards  \nTDS Team | Post 19: -Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.  \n@carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded\nassignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.  \nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other\nstudents also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the\nevaluate.py rest aside Task B.  \nPlease sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this\nproject even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse,\nwe are struggling but still sir we are trying. | Post 20: @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand\n\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude\nhere -\n\n  * Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course **not as a full-time** student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n  * Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n  * Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\nThank you. | Post 21: sir…please extend the deadline…",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you\nahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will\nnormally be called by evaluate.py  \nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the\nDockerfile  \nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your\ndocker image and create the /data folder.\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow\nthe Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project\nsuccessfully):\n\n  1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n  2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.\n  3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n  4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:  \nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running\nthese two scripts.\n\n  5. Run evalute.py using uv.\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly\nconfigured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if\nthe application is producing the right result for each task.\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\nKind regards",

I just want to\nlearn and test my knowledge\n\nThank You,  \n22f2000559. | Post 2: Yeah. There must be a mechanism by which the scores get frozen but students\nare able to practise even after the deadline. | Post 3: @carlton @s.anand Please provide a solution\n\nEdit: @Yogesh1 @22f2000559 There is a way to access GA1 - you can login with\nany other email ID, as the site is meant for general public too. You won’t be\nable to submit the assignments, so you might have to self-evaluate. | Post 4: @22f2000559 – Good point. I’ve enabled access now.\n\n@parthpatel – nice workaround! | Post 5: @carlton @s.anand\n\nSorry to bother you again, but there is another issue about inactive download\nbuttons for required files for the problems. Also it will be nice if the\nevaluations are turned on too. | Post 6: Good point. Fixed now. | Post 7: @s.anand Sir,  \nCan you please enable the evaluations for all GAs who have crossed the\ndeadlines?",

    "content": "Post 1: The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a\nstrong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a\nstructured manner, making it difficult for students to follow. | Post 2: @carlton sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some\nuseful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are\nnever heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least\ntell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our\nhead . | Post 3: Hi Hari,\n\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with\nperhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science.\nDue to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at\nleast get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded\nAssignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions\nwere too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a\nconscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is\nalways difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This\nis why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We\ncannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or\nnot involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students.\nThe quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and\nwell attended.\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just\nintroducing it\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand\nit? That depends on the student.\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them\nbecause only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\nKind regards",

    "topic_title": "Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python",
    "content": "Post 1: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than\ninstalling packages globally, especially when working on projects that require\nmultiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work\non multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual\nenvironments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install\npackages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My\nunderstanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt\nfile, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version\nensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a\nspecific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the\nrequirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases,\nwouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency\nrequirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing\ndependencies efficiently. | Post 2: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when\nworking on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts\nbetween projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main\nreasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n  1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n  2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n  3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n* * *\n\n  1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update\nand break compatibility over time.\n\n  2. **Using requirements.txt**\n\n• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install\nthe exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks\ncompatibility with another developer’s setup.\n\n**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**\n\n• If you **don’t specify a version** , pip install -r requirements.txt will\ninstall the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected\nbreaking changes.\n\n• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)** , you ensure consistency\nbut may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has\ncompatibility issues.\n\n**Handling Version Conflicts**\n\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version\nconstraint and reinstall.\n\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n• Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows\nupdates but avoids major version changes).\n\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n**Best Practices Summary**\n\n  * Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n  * Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.\n  * Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n  * Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards | Post 3: For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or\nflask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the\ndependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation\nis fine.\n\n> For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual\n> environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the\n> deployement\n\n* * *\n\n24f2006531:\n\n> Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install\n> packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\n\nComing to your second question,\n\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version.\nBut if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s\nproject it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n\n* * *\n\n24f2006531:\n\n> My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the\n> requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas\n> specifying a version ensures a specific installation\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version\nis listed.\n\n> Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, `pip3\n> freeze > requirements.txt `. This does the hard work of listing the\n> dependencies for you | Post 4: Thank you sir for clarifying.\n\ncarlton:\n\n> • Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows\n> updates but avoids major version changes).\n\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely\naddress the error I mentioned in my question.",

Just\ncheck if you have got the I grade | Post 3: Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and\nnot repeating the entire course,\n\nI still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure\nthe new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify | Post 4: New ones wont be considered",

    "content": "Post 1: My doubt is that “Will there be any coding level questions in the ROE and the\nweekly graded assignments?” | Post 2: In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them\nusing codes and tools explained in the course .\n\nFor example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and\nyou are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now\nyou can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and\nafter getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .\n\nSame goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.",

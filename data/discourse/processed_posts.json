For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)\n\nkind regards\n\nwhich API should i use in 7th question\n\nneed help in question 4th. how can i correct this json body? sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\n\n```\n[JSON_DATA_REMOVED],\n[JSON_DATA_REMOVED]\n\n```\n\n```\n[JSON_DATA_REMOVED]\n\n```\n\nHi [@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) ,\n\nYou are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.\n\nTake help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body [Vision - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).\n\nKind regards\nJivraj\n\nit worked thanks sir\n\nAre we supposed to buy open ai api key ?\n\nNo, if you scroll down to the last question, we can get our Ai Proxy key\n\nbut the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI\n\nHi Nilay,\n\nYes you would need to use `text-embedding-3-small` model of openai for embedding questions.\n\nKind regards\nJivraj\n\ni have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, **is there any solution to this problem?**\n\nQ5. How to handle the error ? sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\n\nQ4. How to handle this error? [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\n\n```\n[API_RESPONSE_REMOVED],\n\n```\n\nHi Nilay,\n\nYou can run two servers on different port numbers.\n\nHi Vikash,\n\nI looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.\n\nKind regards\n\nYou made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.\n\nKind regards",

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working\n\nHi anant,\n\nQuestion mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.\n\nIn that case 209 would get replaced by 310\n\nHello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”\n\n[@21f2000370](/u/21f2000370) Since you have managed to get all the answers correct, I presume there are no further issues w/ Q16.\n\nHi, I am unable to access Graded Assignment 1. Every time I click on the given link, all I can see is this page. Please advise.\n\nPossible reasons for this issue.\n\n1. Disable/remove Ad blocker\n2. Disable/remove Tracking blocker (Allow third party cookies)\n3. Use Chrome browser\n4. Disable Browser extensions\n\nAs I highlighted earlier, Its not accepting the answer if I follow correct logic for renaming for example 209->210, but it is accepting if rename as 209->310\n\nHi Anant,\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n21f2000370:\n\nHere in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.\n\nIn attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\n\nWhich HTML content we want to take?\n\nHi Suhani,\n\nnpm does not require docker.\n\nKind regards\n\nHi Hisham,\n\nIts described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.\n\nHello Sir. I am unable to install uv in my windows system. Whenever I run the code provided at the reference link in Powershell, my anti-virus system sends a message that it was blocked. Even after blocking Real-time security, uv does not display. What am I doing wrong?\n\nHi, I’m unable to view assignments. below is the screenshot for your reference.\n\nPlease suggest me a way to view it. I have allowed third-party cookies as well.\n\nThanks\n\nHi manmeet,\n\nI don’t know about solution to this.\nSome network setting might be causing problem.\n\nAlternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\n\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.\n\nHi samra,\n\nTry installing some other browser see if that works.\n\nHi mishkat,\n\nWithout sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.",

Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?\n\nIs it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?\n\nIf yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?\n\nHello Sir,\n\nI understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose.

Function calling is better approach here.\n\nHi [@24f2006531](/u/24f2006531)\n\nYou can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)\n\nKind regards\n\nwill the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir\n\nWas the variation because of the datasets?

How did we decide what to evaluate?\n\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.\n\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\n\n## How to fix bugs in our scripts\n\nCreate Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .\n\n### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**\n\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\n[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.

It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.\n\nYou have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.\n\nI have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.\n\nThis was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.\n\nMy evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389\n\nWe will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.\n\nAny suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.\n\n[IMAGE]\n\n22f3002933:\n\n> I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`.

    "content": "[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Greetings sir!\nSir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?\n\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit\n\nYes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\nIs this information available to everyone [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir?\n\nHello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.\n\nNow, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\n\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\n\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\n\nBest regards,\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama\n\nThe Same happened to me. They should have informed this before.\n\nHello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading.

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.\n\nNow I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.\n\nI could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.\n\n**[@carlton](/u/carlton)**, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir ,\n\nThis would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ?\nKindly consider\n\nsame for me also …\nPlease consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\n\nExactly! This should have been informed beforehand.\nIt’s really unfair\n\nIt the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)\nI have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.\n\nRegards:\nAkash\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.\n\nGood evening [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir,\nI hope you are well\n\nAccording to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.\n\nRecently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.\n\nWe genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.\n\nBest regards,\nPalaash V.

Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you\n\nExactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too\nin the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)\n\nThe sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)\nYes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.\nThank you\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge\n\nIf it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this\n\nThanking you\n\nwaiting for your answer",

Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\nDear TDS Team,\n\nThere are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:\n\n1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.\n2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.\n3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.\n\nThe assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nYes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.\n\nbut is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?\n\nLet’s wait for their response.\nI submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\nCan you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2.

Thankyou!\n\nSir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.\nSir can you please consider it. Thank you!\n\nSame here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message.

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\n\nThese things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\n\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\n\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\n\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\n\nKindest regards\n\nSir,\nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.\nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).\nI completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.\nI completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.\nThankyou!\n\nOne thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.\n\nWell noted sir. Thanks a lot!\n\nSir, I received the mail today -\n\nSir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.\n\nSir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.\n\nSir can you please check.\nThankyou",

Please clarify.\n\nI am getting the following response when I am trying to extract credit card number from the credit-card.png :\n\n```\n{'id': 'chatcmpl-<redacted>', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1737872397, 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.\", 'refusal': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 946, 'completion_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 957, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, 'service_tier': 'default', 'system_fingerprint': '<redacted>', 'monthlyCost': 0.07715699999999998, 'cost': 0.0029040000000000003, 'monthlyRequests': 31, 'costError': 'crypto.createHash is not a function'}\n\n```\n\nmy code is as below :\n\n```\ndef extract_credit_card_number():\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n\nBASE_URL = \"http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions\"\nheaders = [JSON_DATA_REMOVED]\"\n\nimage_path = \"../data/credit_card.png\"\n\nwith open(image_path, \"rb\") as image_file:\nbase64_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\npayload = {\n[JSON_DATA_REMOVED],\n\nresponse = requests.post(BASE_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\nresult = response.json()\nprint(\"RESULT:\", result)\ncno = result[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\nprint(\"CREDIT CARD NUMBER:\", cno)\nelse:\nprint(f\"Error: {response.status_code}\")\nprint(response.text)\n\n```\n\nplease guide [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\n\ndo we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nThe bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.\n\nFor more information watch this video <https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat> or watch TDS Live Sessions.\n\nRegards,\nTDS TA\n\nwhat frameworks can we use? hopefully anything?\n\nor what frameworks can’t we use?\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\n\nProject 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:\nDeliverables,\nand *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.\nIf your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.\n\nPlease read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.\n\nSo the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\n\nKind regards\n\n[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)\n\nYou can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.\n\nKind regards\n\nBy clicking the project link ,I am getting the notes…but no project is available in my project 1",

    "content": "[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)\nDear TDS Team,\n\nI hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n\n### 1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\n- **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)\n- **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n### 2. Project Updates\n\n- **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n- **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)\n\n### 3. ROE Score Update\n\n- While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nLakshay\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\n\n[IMAGE]\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\n> **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n[IMAGE]\n\nlakshaygarg654:\n\n> ### 3. ROE Score Update\n> - While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\n\nKind regards\n\nWe do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster.\n\nThanks,\nKind regards\n\nThank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nRegards,\nLakshay",

This is the final Mock before actual ROE.\n\nWe have a **special** session scheduled for tonight from 8pm to 10pm. We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar.\n\nThe meet link for that session is:\n\nROE Preparation - TDS\n\nFriday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm\n\nTime zone: Asia/Kolkata\n\nVideo call link: <https://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw>\n\nThe session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube.\nIt will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later.\n\n## Kind regards, TDS Team\n\n### Update 4\n\n#### 27/02/2025 7:18pm\n\nDear Learner,\n\nPlease find the link to Mock ROE 3 below. Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1):\n\nThe estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins.\n\n## All the best, TDS Team\n\n### Update 3\n\n#### 26/02/2025 8:11 pm\n\nDear Learner\n\nPlease access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:\n\nThere is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.\nAfter the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).\nTo check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.\n\n```\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\n\n```\n\nDo not submit or save your answers.\n\nAll the best!\nKind regards\nTDS Team\n\n### Update 2\n\n#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am\n\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).\nThe link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.\n\nWe will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).\n\nKind regards,\nTDS Team\n\n### Update 1\n\n#### 25/02/2025 7:46pm\n\nWe have now closed the mock submissions.\nBoth the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.\n\n### Announcement\n\n#### 25/02/2025\n\nThis same information is available in the seek portal as well.\n\nThe data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n[Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1)\n\nThe questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n<https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6>\n\nIMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.\n\nThe form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.\n\nWe have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.\n\nWe will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.\n\nAll the best!\n\nShould we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?\n\nFrom where can I get today’s live sessions link\n\neither is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations\n\nUse Google Calendar to share meetings and schedule appointments, for managing what matters in your business and personal life, with Google Workspace.\n\nform link not working\n\nYes we close it at 7:45pm\n\nWe will reopen after live session tonight.\nIts a timed mock.\n\natleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions\n\nlive session gmeet link is not available?\n\nAfter seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.\n\nwhere can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ?\nthanks\n\nWhen will it reopen?\n\ndear [@carlton](/u/carlton)\nwhen will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?\n\n[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)\n\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\n\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n1. The chaos of ROE.\n2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**\n6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n8. How limited the time is.\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\nKind regards\n\nThank you! will check out the session today\n\nHello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"`\nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency\ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\n\n```\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\n```\n\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957\n\nthen i used margin formula as\n\n```\nmargin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\n\n```\n\n```\nAC 4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\nWINNER 1 GURNAM SINGH\nWINNER_PARTY CPI\nWINNER_VOTES 5000.0\nRUNNER_UP 2 MUSTAK MASIH\nRUNNER_UP_PARTY INC\nRUNNER_UP_VOTES 1115.0\nMARGIN_PERCENTAGE 50.599114\n\n```\n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks\n\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\n\nThat answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.\nKind regards.\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps.

    "content": "Dear [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Anand](/u/anand) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi)\n\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\n## **Key Challenges Faced**\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: **Lack of Prerequisites**\n\nThis course did not list any **prerequisites**, leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds**—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**\n\nThe **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**\n\nMany students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback**, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE**, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n\nYes sir please look into this\n\nYes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request.\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@Anand](/u/anand)\n\nRight,\nI put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.\n\nI tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.\n\nI completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.\n\nHi [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\nCould you please look into the above issue?\n\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\n\n### **Grading Concerns**\n\n**Final Course Score:**\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\n\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\n[What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838).\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\n\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n\n### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**\n\n- Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n- The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n- The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n\n### **Request for Improvement**\n\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n\n1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.\n2. **More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\n3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels**, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\n\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.\n\nPlease look into it sir.\n\nThank you [@A\\_LAKSHMI](/u/a_lakshmi) for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\n1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this [Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84) where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the [first page of the TDS course](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n> **This course is quite hard**\n> Here’s students’ feedback:\n> - It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. # # #\n> - Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #\n> - Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #\n> - LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #\n> - The ROE is hard. #\n> **[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\n2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - *Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help*\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n> **We encourage learning by sharing**\n> You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\n> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\n> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.\n\n3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a [nice blog](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/) where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.\n4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - *Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them* The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n6. [@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\n\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\n\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\n\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\n\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\n\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students.\nTDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background.\nIITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.\n\nBut still this is a huge Problem … [Image: :expressionless:]\n\nGreat! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.\n\nTruly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!\n\nSeeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.\n\nYou will survive. Just watch tonight’s session. [Image: :slight_smile:] and prepare and practise.",

I am down to collaborate.\n\nAsking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum.

    "content": "Hello Sir,\n\nI understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\n\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\n\nThanks and Regards\nShalini\n\nTag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…\n\nIt is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\n\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\n\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\n*The problem is the lack of time.*\n\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\n\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\n\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\n\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\n\nKind regards\n\nhi [@carlton](/u/carlton)\nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\n\nYou will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.\nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.\nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!\nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.\n\nKind regards\n\n3 questions:-\n\n- will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?\n- will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?\n- will the live solving video lecture be recorded?\n\nThey will be available after the live session has finished.\n\nWe will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1\n\nYes our live sessions will be recorded.\n\nthanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp 7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset?\n\nHi [@carlton](/u/carlton) , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.\n\nyes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,\nalso when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta\n\nHi [@shubhamatkal](/u/shubhamatkal) ,\n\nFor question1 provided answer is wrong.\nRegarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions.\n\nFor Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately\n\nFor Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers.\n\nKind regards.",

Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.\n\nKind regards\n\nSir I understand but it will badly affects our CGPA.\n\nSir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour?\n\nThe time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the ROE.\n\nKind regards",

Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed\n2. Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.\n\nHow this is beneficial?\n\n1. As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time\n2. Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term\n\nOverall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance and kind consideration\nRegards\nAryan",

I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.\n\nPlease let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).\n\n[@Yogesh](/u/yogesh) GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions.\n\nWe do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet.\n\nKind regards\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nIf possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.\n\nProject 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\n\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\n\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards",

I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time\n4. Any mock or resource to practice from?\n5. additional tips, if any\n\n1. Modules 1 - 5\n2. Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.\n3. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.\n4. We will have some past ROEs as practise\n5. … watch sessions\n\nKind regards\n\nThanks for the answer [@carlton](/u/carlton)\nIs it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?\nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\n\nSir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\n\nROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\n\nKind regards\n\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\n\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” [Image: :nerd_face:]\n\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\n\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\n\nKind regards\n\nIs there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?\n\nDepends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\n\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red)\n\nI have a doubt regarding the bonus mark.

Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name\n\nhow to get the BBC weather API key?\n\nJust a quick query on the Bonus mark.\n\nWould this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?\n\n[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\n\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.\n\nThen once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e *yesteday*, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\n\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]\n\n[/quote]\n\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\n\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\n\nKind regards\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir\nYes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.\n\nI understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered [Image: :frowning:]\n\nKind regards,\nArnav Mehta\n21f3002647\n\nSir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.\n\nSir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.\n\nSir it is a humble request to please consider it.\n\nWarm Regards,\nSatvik Sawhney\n23f2003680",

    "content": "Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir\n\nIt is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.\n\nThanks\nVikram\n\nyes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in previous terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend the deadline or give out some resources.\n\nYes [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) ,\nThe project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work.\nAdditionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our doubts.\n\nSir please extend the deadline it’s really hard to do we need more time\n\nYes, it’s too hectic to balance work and this project\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday\n\nPlease extend the deadline ![:pray:t2:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/pray/2.png?v=12 \":pray:t2:\")\n\n[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very difficult, we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended…\n\nPlease at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.\n\nKindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)\n\nIndeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them.\nEXTEND !!!\n\nKindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday. A slight extension would be greatly helpful.\n\nSIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us 2 to 3 days it was helpful for us.\n\n[@22f1000376](/u/22f1000376) [@22f3000276](/u/22f3000276) [@23f2004636](/u/23f2004636) [@23f2004563](/u/23f2004563) [@sharik4real](/u/sharik4real) [@Mystic\\_9803](/u/mystic_9803) [@Rishabh2](/u/rishabh2) [@23f1002279](/u/23f1002279) [@varun\\_parashar](/u/varun_parashar) [@22f2001175](/u/22f2001175)\n\nand others…\n\nI have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:\n\n- We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\n- All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\n- Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\n- We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\n\n**Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.**\n\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\n\nKind regards\nTDS Team\n\n-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.\nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.\nPlease sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)\n\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -\n\n- Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course **not as a full-time** student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n- Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n- Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\nThank you.\n\nsir…please extend the deadline…",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.\n3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n5. Run evalute.py using uv.\n\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\n\nHope that gives clarity.\n\nKind regards",

    "topic_title": "Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python",
    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n2. **Using requirements.txt**\n\n• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\n\n**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**\n\n• If you **don’t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)**, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n**Handling Version Conflicts**\n\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n• Using **greater than/less than constraints**: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n**Best Practices Summary**\n\n- Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n- Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.\n- Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n- Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\nKind regards\n\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\n\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\n\n> For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n\nComing to your second question,\n\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\n\n> Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\n\nThank you sir for clarifying.\n\nI wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.",

And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?\n\nSaved multiple times on the graded website as well submitted yes on the course tab but the score keeps resetting to 0 with no progress saved\n\n[@24f2006531](/u/24f2006531) [@GaURaVinDeX](/u/gauravindex) [@shubham6](/u/shubham6)\n\nPlease check this fix. It may solve your problem.\n\n> [@23f2005067](/u/23f2005067) [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751) I added a “Recent saves” feature.\n> This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.\n> [[image]](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/e/ce7bbb617fc5997babd5910bd19e8ac3f9c3fe07.png \"image\")\n> Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score.

    "content": "I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\n\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\n\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\n\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

This is the basic prototype.\n\nThis tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.\n\nA heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**, our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.\n\nI’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:\n\n- Expand functionality and evaluation models.\n- Fix bugs and optimize workflows.\n- Improve documentation for broader accessibility.\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!\n\nUpdate: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>\nBest regards,\nAvinash Shrivastava\n\nHi Avinash,\n\nThats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical.

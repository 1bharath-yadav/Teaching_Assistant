# Project Cleanup and Content Quality Verification Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed Temporary Test Files ✅
- Deleted temporary verification scripts from `scripts/` directory:
  - `test_fixed_search_service.py`
  - `test_end_to_end_api.py` 
  - `comprehensive_content_test.py`

### 2. Removed Debug Logging ✅
- Cleaned up temporary debug logging from `api/services/answer_service.py`
- Removed HTML tag detection debug code that was added during testing
- Kept essential logging for context building

### 3. Organized Test Files ✅
- Moved content analysis scripts to proper directories:
  - `test_content_cleaning.py` → `tests/integration/test_content_analysis.py`
  - `test_content_quality.py` → `tests/analysis/test_content_quality.py`
  - `verify_content_quality.py` → `tests/analysis/verify_content_quality.py`

### 4. Created Proper Integration Tests ✅
- Created `tests/integration/test_content_quality.py` with:
  - Async test for search service returning clean content
  - Test for verifying clean_content field exists in TypeSense collections
  - Proper type handling and error checking

### 5. Verified Core Fix Remains Intact ✅
- Confirmed `api/services/search_service.py` still contains the fix:
  - Uses `clean_content` field when available
  - Falls back to raw `content` when clean version isn't available
  - Proper logging for debugging

### 6. End-to-End Verification ✅
- Ran integration tests - all passing
- Tested API endpoint directly - returns clean content without HTML tags
- Confirmed LLM receives properly cleaned content

## Key Results

1. **Clean Codebase**: Removed all temporary test files and debug code
2. **Organized Tests**: Proper test organization following project structure
3. **Working Solution**: Content cleaning pipeline fully functional
4. **Verification**: Integration tests ensure continued quality

## Next Steps

The project is now properly organized and the content cleaning issue has been resolved. The LLM consistently receives cleaned content without HTML tags, as originally requested.

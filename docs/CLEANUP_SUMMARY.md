# Unused File Cleanup Summary

**Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Task**: Clean up unused files after replacing complex OCR system with LangChain multimodal processing

## Files Removed

### 🗑️ Service Files
- **`api/services/image_service.py`**
  - Complex EasyOCR and PyPDF2 based image processing service
  - 250+ lines of custom OCR logic
  - Replaced by simplified LangChain multimodal service

### 🗑️ Test Files  
- **`tests/unit/test_ocr.py`**
  - 102 lines of EasyOCR integration tests
  - No longer needed with LangChain approach
- **`tests/unit/test_image_processing.py`**
  - Empty file, likely intended for old image processing tests

## Dependencies Removed

### 📦 Direct Dependencies
```toml
# Removed from pyproject.toml
"easyocr>=1.7.2"              # OCR processing library
"pypdf2>=3.0.1"               # PDF text extraction
"opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0"  # Image processing for OCR
```

### 📦 Sub-dependencies (automatically removed)
- `imageio==2.37.0`
- `lazy-loader==0.4`  
- `ninja==1.11.1.4`
- `pyclipper==1.3.0.post6`
- `python-bidi==0.6.6`
- `scikit-image==0.25.2`
- `shapely==2.1.1`
- `tifffile==2025.6.1`

**Total**: 11 packages removed

## Code Updates

### 🔧 Modified Files
- **`api/services/__init__.py`**
  - Removed `EnhancedImageProcessor` import and export
  - Simplified service module exports

## Benefits Achieved

### 📉 Reduced Complexity
- **250+ lines** of custom OCR code eliminated
- **11 dependencies** removed from the project
- Simplified service architecture

### 🚀 Improved Maintainability  
- Single LangChain-based multimodal processing approach
- Standardized interface across different LLM providers
- Reduced dependency management overhead

### ✅ Maintained Functionality
- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- Backward compatibility preserved through wrapper functions
- Same function signatures maintained

## Verification

### ✅ Tests Passed
- All imports working correctly
- LangChain multimodal processor functional
- Backward compatibility functions operational
- HTTP requests to Ollama successful

### ✅ System Status
- **Dependencies**: Cleaned and updated
- **Imports**: All functional
- **API**: Fully operational
- **Performance**: Maintained with simplified codebase

## Impact Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Image Processing Dependencies | 3 + 8 sub-deps | 0 | -11 packages |
| Custom OCR Code Lines | 250+ | 0 | -250+ lines |
| Service Complexity | High (EasyOCR + PyPDF2) | Low (LangChain) | Simplified |
| Maintainability | Complex | Simple | Improved |
| Functionality | Full | Full | Maintained |

**Result**: Successfully simplified the Teaching Assistant's image processing system while maintaining full functionality and improving maintainability.
